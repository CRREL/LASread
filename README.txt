LASread
=======

A light-weight open source (LGPL) package for reading LAS/LAZ files. This code is a completely re-engineered subset of the popular LASlib library of LAStools. It has been significantly simplified to better suit the requirements of the request for proposals of the ASPRS for the LAS Validation Suite (LVS). One advantage of the immediate release of open source is that it can immediately be field-tested and crowd-improved and allow others to to contribute bug fixes and implementation concerns early. Furthermore this code will seamlessly integrate the LASzip compression library so that files in the LAS format can also be verified directly in their lossless compressed twin representation, the LAZ format.
